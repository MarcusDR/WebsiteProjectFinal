                <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Hello! My name is Marcus and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh. I am an environmental science major and would like to find a career that involes doing work surrounding aquatic ecosystems. As you might have figured out, my biggest hobby currently is astrophotography, while I also dabble in wildlife photography. I also enjoy skiing, hiking, biking, and playing videogames. 
              </p>
              <p>During my time at Pitt, I took many classes not pertaining to environmental science. One of these classes called "Composing Digital Media" taught me how to code using HTML and CSS to build this website as one of our projects. I took this opportunity to display some photography I have done as well as another project I did during that class. The "Visit a Dark Sky!" banner on the astrophotography page was part of my "Visual Argument" project. This project was used as a means of either informing people who see the visual argument on something or telling them something they should do such as mine.</p>
