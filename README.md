# Website Project Final

I chose to create a website displaying my astrophotography and wildlife photography. I also chose to include my updated visual argument project as it fits well with the content of the website. 
There is an about page with a brief "about me" paragraphh as well as a list of the photography equipment I use for anyone curious.
This website serves as a personal gallery where I can share my photography. In the future, I would like to add a basic guide to how to do astrophotography as well as what is involved in the process. I'd also like to add brief descriptions of the objects imaged.
